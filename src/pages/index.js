            Heartbroken by the sudden closure of the Our Montessori School in Yorktown in 2020, a pioneering and dedicated small group of families formed a homeschool co-op called My Montessori. Using one of the original Our Montessori buildings, successfully hiring two of the wonderful instructors, and utilizing the same Montessori instructional methods and implements the homeschool ran uninterrupted during the 2020-2021 academic year.

              <p>
              My Montessori offers two classes. A Junior class which is the 1st through 3rd-grade students taught by Randa Dobrayel. A Seniors class which is the 4th through 6th-grade students taught by Deniz Soyuer. Morning instruction is done separately by class and often collectively for afternoon lessons. This method fosters a sense of community and provides mentorship experiences.
